## GenAI Summer Camp Details

The GenAI Summer Camp is a place where imagination meets innovation, offering a unique and immersive experience for young minds. The camp is designed to foster creativity and pique interest in cutting-edge technologies. With offerings like Robotics and AI, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Coding, campers are given the tools to explore, create, and innovate. The camp values imagination, collaboration, and lifelong learning.

## Conversational Assistant Prompts

### Router Prompt
While the code provides a structured approach to handling various queries, a concise description of the router prompt's function and operation would be beneficial here.

### Question Prompt
The `question` prompt is optimized for answering questions about the camp. It leverages the `FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate` with a system message that offers a backdrop about the assistant's role and the camp's details.

### Application Prompt
The `application` prompt is designed for handling camp sign-ups. Similar to the question prompt, it uses a few-shot approach, guiding the assistant based on past examples to handle the application process smoothly.

## Documentation

### Approach

The GenAI Summer Camp Assistant is developed using a modular approach. With the use of the `langchain` library, various chains like `MultiPromptChain` and `ConversationChain` are implemented. Memory is managed with `ConversationBufferMemory`, ensuring that past interactions are remembered, making the conversation flow more naturally.

The prompts, like `FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate`, employ a few-shot learning approach. By providing the assistant with a series of examples, it can generalize and respond to diverse user queries effectively.

### Running the Solution

To run the solution:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.9.7 installed.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
3. Install necessary libraries using the integrated terminal in VSCode.
4. Execute the provided Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks.
